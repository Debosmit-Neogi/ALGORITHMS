This repository contains codes of  various algorithms required for coding interview preparation

 ## KADANE'S  ALGORITHM:
    kadane's algorithm helps us to compute maximum subarray sum in linear time -> O(N); where N is the size of the input array.
    According to kadane's algorithm , we don't need to compute sums of all possible subarray (and find out the greatest sum). 
    Instead, we can do in a single loop by maintaining 2 variables (current_sum, max_sum)."max_sum" variable gives the maximum sum of subarray.
